Data dictionary: 
File naming convention: Output files after running this script are named with the following convention, (emission_channel)-(field_of_view).csv. E.g., the file O1S-FD represents data from the O(1S) emission line using forward- and backward-looking observations.
Important Note: Within the CSV file for any float values, NaN values are represented as 1e32. Missing data values are represented by N/A, Missing data is caused by either missing or corrupted data values from original Windii files.
